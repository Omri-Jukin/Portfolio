# Email Debugging Todo

## Issue
Contact form emails are not being sent after updating AWS access and secret access keys.

## Todo List

### 1. Environment Variables Check
- [x] Verify AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID is set in Cloudflare Workers environment
- [x] Verify AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY is set in Cloudflare Workers environment  
- [x] Verify AWS_REGION is set (defaults to us-east-1)
- [x] Verify SES_FROM_EMAIL is set
- [x] Verify ADMIN_EMAIL is set (defaults to omrijukin@gmail.com)

### 2. AWS SES Configuration
- [ ] Check if SES is properly configured in the AWS region
- [ ] Verify the from email address is verified in SES
- [ ] Check if SES is out of sandbox mode (if needed)
- [ ] Verify SES sending limits and quotas

### 3. Cloudflare Workers Environment
- [x] Check if environment variables are properly set in Cloudflare Workers
- [x] Verify the wrangler configuration includes environment variables
- [x] Test environment variable access in the worker

### 4. Code Debugging
- [x] Add more detailed error logging to email service
- [x] Test email service directly with a simple test
- [x] Check if the tRPC router is receiving the request
- [x] Verify the email service instantiation

### 5. Testing
- [x] Create a simple test endpoint to verify AWS credentials
- [x] Test SES connectivity directly
- [x] Verify the email templates are working

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was:
1. ✅ **Environment variables not properly set in Cloudflare Workers** - This was the root cause
2. AWS SES configuration issues
3. AWS credentials not having proper SES permissions
4. SES sandbox mode restrictions

## Solution Implemented
1. ✅ Set all required environment variables in Cloudflare Workers using `wrangler secret put`
2. ✅ Added detailed error logging to the email service
3. ✅ Created admin dashboard for testing email functionality
4. ✅ Added SES connectivity test endpoint
5. ✅ Deployed updated code to Cloudflare Workers

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Test the contact form to verify emails are now being sent
2. ✅ Use the admin dashboard to test SES connectivity
3. ✅ Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. ✅ Verify SES configuration if issues persist
