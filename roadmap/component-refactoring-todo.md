## ðŸŽ‰ REFACTORING COMPLETE

All tasks have been successfully completed! The ScrollingSections component has been successfully refactored into individual, modular components with proper TypeScript support, styled components, and a clean locale structure.

### Summary of Changes:

- âœ… Created 6 individual components (Hero, About, QA, Services, Projects, Contact)
- âœ… Each component has proper TypeScript types, styled components, and constants
- âœ… Updated ScrollingSections to use the new modular components
- âœ… Refactored all locale files (en, es, fr, he) to component-based structure
- âœ… Removed duplicated data and old scrollingSections sections
- âœ… All linting and build checks pass successfully

The codebase is now more maintainable, modular, and follows better architectural patterns!
