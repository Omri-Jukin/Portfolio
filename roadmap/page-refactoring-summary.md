# Page Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored all portfolio pages to use the new component-based locale structure, eliminating the old `scrollingSections` root key and organizing translations by component.

## Pages Updated

### 1. Resume Page (`src/app/[locale]/resume/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**

- Updated to use new locale structure: `skills.categories.technical.skills` and `skills.categories.soft.skills`
- Fixed TypeScript types: `TechnicalSkill` and `SoftSkill` with proper properties
- Replaced Material-UI Grid components with Box components to avoid API issues
- Updated project references to use `projects.projects` instead of `projects.list`
- Added proper type safety for skill technologies and descriptions

**Key Updates:**

- Technical skills now display with progress bars and technology chips
- Soft skills show descriptions with percentage indicators
- Projects section uses the new locale structure
- Responsive layout using flexbox instead of Grid

### 2. About Page (`src/app/[locale]/about/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**

- Completely restructured to use new `about` locale structure
- Removed dependency on old `interests` locale section
- Added proper TypeScript types for `SkillDetail`
- Created dynamic skill cards that display from `about.skillDetails`
- Added skills overview section using `about.skills`

**Key Updates:**

- Skills overview displays as chips from `about.skills`
- Detailed skill cards show experience, technologies, and examples
- Responsive grid layout for skill details
- Proper type safety for all skill data

### 3. Career Page (`src/app/[locale]/career/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**

- Updated locale references to use new structure
- Changed `description` to `subtitle` and `experience` to `description`
- Maintained existing experience timeline functionality
- Added proper responsive layout

**Key Updates:**

- Uses `career.subtitle` and `career.description` from new locale structure
- Experience timeline remains unchanged but uses updated locale paths
- Responsive design maintained

### 4. Contact Page (`src/app/[locale]/contact/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**

- Updated contact info references to use new nested structure
- Changed from `t("email")` to `t("info.emailValue")`
- Updated all contact information paths to use `info.` prefix

**Key Updates:**

- Contact form functionality unchanged
- Contact information now uses `contact.info.*` structure
- All form fields and validation remain the same

## Technical Improvements

### TypeScript Enhancements

- Added proper type definitions for all skill structures
- Created `TechnicalSkill`, `SoftSkill`, and `SkillDetail` types
- Eliminated all `any` type usage
- Improved type safety across all pages

### Layout Improvements

- Replaced problematic Material-UI Grid components with Box components
- Implemented responsive flexbox layouts
- Maintained visual consistency across all pages
- Improved mobile responsiveness

### Code Quality

- All pages pass ESLint checks
- Production build completes successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- Consistent code structure across all pages

## Locale Structure Alignment

### Before (Old Structure)

```json
{
  "scrollingSections": {
    "hero": { ... },
    "about": { ... },
    "qa": { ... },
    "services": { ... },
    "projects": { ... },
    "contact": { ... }
  },
  "skills": { ... },
  "projects": { ... },
  "interests": { ... }
}
```

### After (New Structure)

```json
{
  "hero": { ... },
  "about": { ... },
  "qa": { ... },
  "services": { ... },
  "projects": { ... },
  "contact": { ... },
  "skills": { ... },
  "career": { ... },
  "resume": { ... }
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All pages now use the same component-based locale structure
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to manage translations with clear component separation
3. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types eliminate runtime errors
4. **Performance**: Cleaner code structure and better build optimization
5. **Scalability**: New structure supports easier addition of new components and pages

## Testing Status

- ✅ All pages compile successfully
- ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ Production build passes
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ Responsive layouts maintained
- ✅ All locale references updated correctly

## Next Steps

The portfolio is now ready for testing with the new component-based structure. All pages should function correctly with the updated locale files and maintain the same user experience while providing better code organization and maintainability.
